I'm a master's student in computer science at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) with a focus on AI. My main interests lie in reinforcement learning, quantitative finance and applying machine learning to complex real world systems.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer specializing in low latency system software at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/). I worked on **L3 routing** and stateful switchover mechanisms within the [Extensible Operating System](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos). 

I did my bachelor's in computer science from [Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad](https://iitpkd.ac.in), where I collaborated with [Dr. Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/people/chandrasekhar-lakshminarayanan/) on problems related to **Reinforcement Learning** and **Portfolio Management**. I have also worked with [Dr. Sarmistha Singh](https://sites.google.com/iitpkd.ac.in/sarmistha-arl) on **time series forecasting** for **climate modeling**.

Iâ€™m thrilled to connect and collaborate with other researchers and students. Feel free to reach out if you want to team up on some cool AI projects!
