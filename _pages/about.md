Hi, I'm Ishwar. I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

I am interested in building intelligent systems that can model complex environments and make optimal decisions under uncertainty. My primary focus is on Reinforcement Learning and its applications in Quantitative Finance.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/) where I worked on **L3 routing** and stateful switchover mechanisms within the [Extensible Operating System](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos). 

I receieved my bachelor's in computer science from [Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad](https://iitpkd.ac.in), where I collaborated with [Dr. Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/people/chandrasekhar-lakshminarayanan/) on problems related to **Reinforcement Learning** and **Portfolio Management** and with [Dr. Sarmistha Singh](https://sites.google.com/iitpkd.ac.in/sarmistha-arl) on **time series forecasting** for **climate modeling**.

I'm always excited to connect with other researchers and engineers. Feel free to reach out if you're working on similar problems :)
