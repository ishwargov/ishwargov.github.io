Implemented a Risk-Sensitive Actor-Critic (RAC) algorithm and a Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method for Portfolio Management. The performance of various DRL agents for portfolio management during COVID recession were compared against each other and Transformer-based PPO outperformed others in profitability and strategic allocation.
